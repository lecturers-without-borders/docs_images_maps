# Content
Here we gather formal open documents, images for presentations, maps for sharing with colleagues, NGOs and collaborators. 
Main content is from the website of our project https://scied.network/
Work in progress on Code of conduct and formal collaborative documents.

## Documents and Images
In folder *docs_images_maps* we collect images and plots from open data visualisation, which we are using for the presentations about "Lecturers without borders".
In subfolder *documents* we put Memorandum of Understanding for collaborations between schools and "Lecturers without borders". 
Code of Conduct of "Lecturers without borders" is the document, where we explain our standards.
In subfolder *presentations* we put some presentations we gave in conferences with and about "Lecturers without borders".

## Code 
We also put some recent code for analysis of open and depersonalized data for functionality of "Lecturers without borders".
